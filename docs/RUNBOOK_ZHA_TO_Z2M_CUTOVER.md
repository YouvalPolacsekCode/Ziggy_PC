# ZHA → Zigbee2MQTT Cut-over Runbook

**Purpose:** One-time, planned migration of the canary (founder's house) from
ZHA to Zigbee2MQTT. ~3–4 hours, single evening, hands-on at every Zigbee
device in the home.

**Audience:** Founder (you), at the canary, with the mini PC and the
Zigbee coordinator on the LAN.

**Last updated:** 2026-06-15.

**Related:** [DESIGN_BACKUP_DR.md](../DESIGN_BACKUP_DR.md),
[scripts/migrate_zha_to_z2m.py](../scripts/migrate_zha_to_z2m.py),
[docker/z2m-data.example/configuration.yaml](../docker/z2m-data.example/configuration.yaml).

## Why this runbook exists

Tuya devices (Aliexpress / Israeli market) use the proprietary 0xEF00
Zigbee cluster. ZHA's coverage of that cluster (via zha-device-handlers
quirks) is incomplete and slow-moving; Zigbee2MQTT (via Koenkk's
[zigbee-herdsman-converters](https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee-herdsman-converters))
has 3000+ devices supported plus a generic Tuya converter for unknown
models. ~28% of the canary's existing Zigbee install base is already
Tuya, and the share is growing. This migration is the call.

This is a one-way door for paired devices: there is no in-place
migration of pairings between ZHA and Z2M. Every device gets factory
reset and re-paired. Plan accordingly.

---

## What's at risk

**Re-paired devices change entity_ids in HA.** Anywhere Ziggy or HA
stores a Zigbee entity_id (automations, dashboards, Ziggy's
device_registry.json, settings.yaml sensor_alerts, IR hybrid links)
will be stale until remapped. The [migration script](../scripts/migrate_zha_to_z2m.py)
remaps Ziggy's stores; HA automations are remapped via the same script
over HA's REST API.

**1-week rollback window.** Keep the ZHA integration installed-but-disabled
in HA for one week after cut-over. Reverting means re-enabling ZHA
(devices stay paired in ZHA's network because we don't depair them
from ZHA's side — we just stop ZHA and bring up Z2M alongside, taking
control of the coordinator). Past the 1-week mark, remove ZHA.

---

## Preflight (do BEFORE cut-over evening)

### 1. Confirm the canary's posture

- [ ] On the mini PC, `docker compose ps` shows `homeassistant`,
      `mosquitto`, `ziggy` all healthy.
- [ ] HA's MQTT integration is connected (HA → Settings → Integrations
      → MQTT shows "Connected").
- [ ] SLZB-06 coordinator IP is reachable from the mini PC:
      `nc -zv <coordinator_ip> 6638` returns "succeeded".
- [ ] Latest nightly backup landed in B2:
      `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" "$RELAY_URL/api/homes/$HOME_ID/backup-status"`
      shows `last_backup_at` within 24h.

### 2. Snapshot the ZHA state

A fresh backup is your rollback safety net.

```bash
# Trigger an out-of-cycle backup so latest/ has the freshest ZHA state.
docker compose exec ziggy python -m services.backup_engine --once
```

Verify the run completed and uploaded `zha-network-backup.json.enc`.

### 3. Extract the ZHA network key

The Z2M configuration.yaml needs `pan_id`, `ext_pan_id`, and `network_key`
to (a) match the network parameters of the existing mesh and (b) skip
re-encryption when devices rejoin during the re-pair walk.

```bash
docker compose exec homeassistant \
  jq '.data.network_settings | {network_key: .network_info.network_key.key,
                                 pan_id: .network_info.pan_id,
                                 ext_pan_id: .network_info.extended_pan_id,
                                 channel: .network_info.channel.channel}' \
  /config/.storage/core.zigbee_network_backup_*.json
```

Copy these into `docker/z2m-data.example/configuration.yaml`'s `advanced:`
block (you'll move this into the live data dir below).

### 4. Stand up the Z2M data dir

```bash
cp -r docker/z2m-data.example docker/z2m-data
# edit docker/z2m-data/configuration.yaml — fill in:
#   - serial.port: tcp://<coordinator_ip>:6638
#   - advanced.network_key, pan_id, ext_pan_id, channel from step 3
```

### 5. Prime the empty mapping.yaml

Create `~/cutover-mapping.yaml`. You'll fill the `entities:` list as
you walk the house. Example skeleton:

```yaml
entities:
  # - old: binary_sensor.lumi_lumi_sensor_motion_aq2_occupancy
  #   new: binary_sensor.kitchen_motion
```

---

## Cut-over evening

### Step 1 — Disable ZHA in HA (frees the coordinator)

HA UI → Settings → Devices & Services → ZHA → ⋮ → "Disable". Do NOT
delete the integration — disabling preserves the config for rollback.

When ZHA is disabled it releases the TCP socket on the SLZB-06; Z2M can
then claim it.

### Step 2 — Start Z2M

```bash
COMPOSE_PROFILES=zigbee-z2m docker compose up -d zigbee2mqtt
docker compose logs -f zigbee2mqtt
```

Wait for the log line `[INFO] zigbee2mqtt: Coordinator firmware version: ...`.
That confirms Z2M owns the radio. If it hangs at "Starting zigbee-herdsman",
the SLZB-06 is still claimed by ZHA — go back and double-check ZHA is
disabled.

Open `http://<mini-pc-ip>:8099` — Z2M's web UI. You'll use this to
permit-join devices during the walk.

### Step 3 — Walk the house, re-pair every device

Pick a room. For each device in that room:

1. **Factory reset the device.** Method varies:
   - Aqara button-press sensors: hold the small button ~5 s until LED flashes.
   - Tuya bulbs (TS0505B, Zbeacon, `_TZ3210_*`): power cycle 5× quickly
     (off-on-off-on-off-on-off-on-off-on); bulb flashes when reset.
   - SONOFF SNZB-04PR2: hold the pairing button on the back ~5 s.
   - eWeLink SNZB-02P: hold the button on the back ~5 s.
   - HOBEIAN mmWave: small reset button on the device housing, ~5 s.
2. **Open permit-join in Z2M.** In the web UI: top right "Permit join"
   → 254 seconds.
3. **Wait for the device** to appear in the Z2M devices list. Note its
   new `friendly_name` (defaults to a Z2M-generated ID like
   `0x00158d0001234567`). Click → rename to something stable (e.g.
   `kitchen_motion`).
4. **Look up the old ZHA entity_id** for this device. HA → Settings →
   Devices → search for the device's room/type — copy the old entity_id
   from the Disabled-ZHA integration (entities stick around in the
   registry even when their integration is disabled).
5. **Add to mapping.yaml:**
   ```yaml
   entities:
     - old: binary_sensor.lumi_lumi_sensor_motion_aq2_occupancy
       new: binary_sensor.kitchen_motion
   ```

Tip: do one room at a time. Don't try to factory-reset everything
upfront — devices that have been factory-reset but not yet re-paired
are dead weight.

### Step 4 — Special handling: the HOBEIAN trio (gamble path)

We confirmed during preflight that the three HOBEIAN devices
(CK-BL702-MWS-01(7016) ×2, ZG-303Z ×1) are Tuya-OEM with cluster
0xEF00 but their exact model strings aren't in Z2M's converter index.
Expected outcomes when you re-pair them:

| What Z2M does | What you do |
|---|---|
| Recognises and exposes full entities (presence, lux, temp) | Treat as any other device |
| Recognises generically — entities show but with raw DP names | Add an `external_converter` .js (template TBD; see Z2M docs on "external converters") to map DPs to friendly entities |
| Doesn't recognise at all | Pair anyway, leave on ZHA temporarily by re-enabling ZHA after the migration completes for these 3 devices only — accepted compromise per the preflight gamble |

### Step 5 — Run the migration script

After every device is re-paired and mapping.yaml is complete:

```bash
# Dry run first — print what WILL change without writing.
docker compose exec ziggy python -m scripts.migrate_zha_to_z2m \
  --mapping /app/user_files/cutover-mapping.yaml \
  --ha-url "$HA_URL" \
  --ha-token "$HA_TOKEN" \
  --dry-run
```

Read the dry-run summary. Confirm:
- `device_registry.remapped` ≈ the number of Zigbee devices in mapping.yaml
- `settings_yaml.remapped` matches the number of sensor_alerts /
  global_sensors entries that point at Zigbee entities
- `ir_devices.remapped` matches the number of hybrid IR devices (likely 0)
- `ha_automations.automations_touched` ≈ the number of automations that
  reference Zigbee entities
- No `error:` lines

If the dry-run looks right, re-run without `--dry-run`:

```bash
docker compose exec ziggy python -m scripts.migrate_zha_to_z2m \
  --mapping /app/user_files/cutover-mapping.yaml \
  --ha-url "$HA_URL" \
  --ha-token "$HA_TOKEN"
```

### Step 6 — Restart Ziggy + verify

```bash
docker compose restart ziggy
```

In the Ziggy UI:
- [ ] Devices page lists all re-paired devices with the right rooms.
- [ ] Toggle a known-good light → it responds.
- [ ] Trigger a motion sensor → state change shows in the activity log.
- [ ] Sensor alerts (if configured) fire on the new entity_ids.

In Home Assistant:
- [ ] Settings → Automations → spot-check 3 automations open without an
      "Entity not found" warning.

### Step 7 — Trigger a fresh backup

```bash
docker compose exec ziggy python -m services.backup_engine --once
```

Verify the manifest's `zigbee_stack` is now `z2m` and the bundle
contains `z2m-data.tar.gz.enc` (not `zha-network-backup.json.enc`).

---

## Rollback window (1 week)

For the next 7 days, ZHA stays installed-but-disabled in HA. If
something is fundamentally broken on the new stack:

1. Stop Z2M: `docker compose stop zigbee2mqtt`
2. Re-enable ZHA in HA UI → Settings → Devices & Services → ZHA → ⋮ → "Enable"
3. Devices that were re-paired with Z2M are now in Z2M's network only —
   they need to be factory-reset and re-paired to ZHA. (This is why
   we say "1-week window," not "indefinite": rollback cost grows the
   longer you wait.)

After 1 week without rollback, remove ZHA:

1. HA UI → ZHA → Delete integration.
2. Delete the now-stale `core.zigbee_network_backup_*.json` from
   `/config/.storage/` (Ziggy's backup engine will stop trying to
   collect it once `_detect_zigbee_stack` returns `z2m`, but the file
   is no longer protected by the allowlist either way).

---

## Verification checklist (24h post-cutover)

- [ ] First nightly backup lands and `manifest.json.enc → zigbee_stack` is `z2m`.
- [ ] No `Entity not found` errors in HA logs.
- [ ] Anomaly engine starts producing scores again (takes ~24h to
      re-learn baseline timings on the new entity_ids — expected).
- [ ] Pattern detector has re-populated `user_files/events.jsonl`
      with new entity_ids.
- [ ] HOBEIAN devices either: report sensible presence/temp/humidity,
      OR are documented as known-degraded in the cut-over notes.
